Proud to share the completion of our Auto-Parking Car Project, developed for the Microprocessors course after a month of continuous work, testing, and teamwork.

Thanks to the great collaboration with my amazing teammates [THEIR MENTIONS], we successfully built an intelligent auto-parking car with multiple control and decision-making modes.

🚗 System Modes

Manual Mode: Full control via mobile app

Autonomous Mode: Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors

Auto-Parking Mode: Automatic detection and parking execution

Path Learning Mode: Recording and replaying learned paths

🔧 Hardware Used

ESP32: Main controller with Bluetooth & Wi-Fi

L298N (LSD596) motor driver: Motor speed and direction control

4 DC motors: Robot movement

2 ultrasonic sensors: Autonomous & parking operations

Servo motor + ultrasonic sensor: 180° environment scanning

3 lithium batteries in series + capacitor: Stable and regulated power supply

💻 Software Features

Clean and well-structured Arduino code

Smooth and simple mode switching

Bluetooth-based motion and mode control

Custom Flutter mobile app for sending & receiving data

Battery monitoring with warning alerts

This project allowed me to strongly integrate my electrical engineering studies with software development, especially by connecting the embedded system to a Flutter mobile application for better control and usability.

A valuable hands-on experience in embedded systems, robotics, and system integration.
